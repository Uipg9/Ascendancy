## 🌟 Concept: "The Eternal Journey"

Ascendancy is a seamless prestige system that rewards you for simply playing the game. **Ascend** to reset your world progress in exchange for permanent power upgrades - no new items or blocks, just pure vanilla+ progression.

> *"Every ending is a new beginning. Every death, a rebirth stronger than before."*

## ♻️ The Cycle

1. **⚔️ The Life** - Play Minecraft. Kill mobs, mine ores, farm crops, explore! Your actions fill the **Soul Bar**.
2. **✨ The Ascension** - When ready, choose ONE precious item to keep and trigger the ritual.
3. **🌌 The Rebirth** - Descend from the heavens into a brand new world, far from your origins.
4. **💪 The Evolution** - Spend **Prestige Points** on permanent upgrades that persist forever.
